	<description>Recovered from fragmented archives of Old Earth’s final war, the AVT-40 is a rare automatic battle rifle — a desperate evolution of the SVT-40, built to fire the punishing 7.62×54mmR round. Powerful but unstable, it was plagued by recoil, rapid wear, and frequent failure, yet still saw frontline use during humanity’s darkest conflict.

Centuries later, a corrupted schematic was salvaged from a long-dead drone. Reassembled by a determined weaponsmith, the AVT-40 now roars again — flawed, fearsome, and reborn on the Rim.</description>
