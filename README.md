# AVT-40 — A Desperate Experiment Reborn

Recovered from corrupted archives deep in a derelict Rimworld databank, the **AVT-40** is a rare relic of Old Earth’s bloodiest era — an unstable automatic battle rifle, forged in desperation and abandoned in failure.  

Originally developed as a full-auto variant of the SVT-40 during the Second World War, the AVT-40 was chambered in the punishing 7.62×54mmR cartridge. Intended to give infantry the firepower of a light machine gun in a rifle’s frame, it proved too much for its body to handle. Recoil was brutal, parts wore out quickly, and accuracy crumbled under full-auto fire. It was short-lived, but unforgettable.  

Centuries later, long after Earth fell silent, fragments of its design were rediscovered on the Rim. Rebuilt from decayed files and scrap, the AVT-40 roars again — heavy, unstable, and undeniably human.  

A flawed tool. A desperate design. Still firing.
